## 1. Introduction
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness among working-age adults worldwide, affecting approximately one-third of people with diabetes. Early detection and treatment can prevent up to 98% of severe vision loss cases. However, manual screening is time-consuming and requires specialized ophthalmological expertise that may not be readily available in all regions.

This project addresses these challenges by developing an automated deep learning-based system for DR detection. Our solution leverages state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze retinal fundus images and provide immediate preliminary assessments, enabling faster triage and early intervention.

## 2. Methodology

### Data
- **Source**: APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection Dataset
- **Total Images**: 3,662 high-resolution retinal images
- **Classes**: 
  - 0: No DR (Healthy)
  - 1: Diabetic Retinopathy (Mild to Proliferative)
- **Data Split**:
  - Training: 2,930 images (80%)
  - Validation: 366 images (10%)
  - Testing: 366 images (10%)

### Data Analysis
We conducted RGB channel analysis on the training dataset to understand the color distribution and characteristics of the retinal images:

| Channel | Mean    | Std     | Min | Max | Median  |
|---------|---------|---------|-----|-----|---------|
| Red     | 0.1022  | 0.0887  | 0.0 | 1.0 | 0.0863  |
| Green   | 0.2463  | 0.1545  | 0.0 | 1.0 | 0.2745  |
| Blue    | 0.4412  | 0.2774  | 0.0 | 1.0 | 0.5176  |

**Key Findings**:
- The blue channel shows the highest mean and median values, indicating it carries more information in retinal images
- Red channel has the tightest distribution (lowest std), suggesting less variability in red components
- All channels span the full [0,1] range, indicating good contrast in the dataset
- The distribution plot is saved at `results/rgb_distributions.png`

### Models
We implemented and compared four state-of-the-art CNN architectures:
1. **ResNet50** - Our best performing model
2. **InceptionV3** - Known for efficient feature extraction
3. **EfficientNetB0** - Lightweight and efficient
4. **EfficientNetB4** - Deeper variant with more parameters

### Evaluation Metrics
